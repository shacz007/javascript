We've seen how to iterate through arrays using for loops. 
But JavaScript also has a number of built-in methods on arrays, called iterators, 
which can often be used in place of for loops. Choosing the right iterator can 
allow you to write code that's both shorter and easier to read. Before we get into
trade offs between loops and iterators too much, though, let's take a look at the
iterators available to you in JavaScript.
